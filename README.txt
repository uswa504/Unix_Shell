I have changed the prompt of my shell in first 2 commits using getcwd command.
tried to implement signal handler but there are still some issues. Handled the signal using signal().
Now in myshellv2.c i am trying to implement I/O redirection and wrote 2 functions of them. Took help from dreamincode.net in case of I/o redirection. lets hope that it works!!!!!!!!!!
